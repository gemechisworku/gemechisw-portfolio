## Overview

In this project, I developed a UI for an online shopping website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without any frameworks. This was done for educational purposes to enhance my understanding of core web technologies.

## Key Features

- **Home Page**: Intuitive, and professional looking home page with list of featured products, and reviews from valued customers.
- **Products**: A page where a list of products in stock are shown with a link to the product-details page when clicking individual products - cloths in this case.
- **Login/Register**: Login and Register functionalities built on the same page leveraging the power of javascript for seamless transition and navigation.
- **Contacts and Feedback**: Simple, and illegant feedback page where we take feedbacks is available for improving our user experiences.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For building basic web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the websites and give them a better look.
- **Javascipt**: For adding dynamism to the webpages.
- **GitHub**: For version control.

## Challenges and Learnings

I got distracted with work stuff and couldn't really finish the project as intended. I hope I will come back to it very soon. Stay Tuned!

## Outcome
A fully functional online shopping website UI with backend and other features to be added soon.
