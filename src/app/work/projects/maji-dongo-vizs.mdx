## Overview

Visualization of various data analytics findings for Maji-Dongo - a hypothetical country and data designed for educational purpose.

## Dashboard Contents

- **Crime Dashboard**: For visualizing crime data in Maji-Dongo interms of victim gender, provinces where the crimes happened, and the time of the crimes.  
- **Water Sources Dashboard**: various charts showing water sources in maji-dongo interms of water source types, provinces, and location types (urban or rural).
- **Access to Basic Services Dashboard**: Shows percentage of population with access to basic services, improvements made to the services per province, bugdet vs costs, and project completions.

## Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Power BI**: For creating the dashboard, and the charts.
- **DAX**: A query language that comes with Power BI for data manipulation, transformation and analytics.

## Challenges and Learnings

The challenge I faced was working with DAX and various MS Power BI features, as this was my first time working on the app. However, Iâ€™ve learned that the app is incredibly powerful for manipulating, transforming, and visualizing large datasets, enabling interactive insights in the process.

## Outcome

The Dashboard is currently being used by the management of Maji-Dongo to gain valuable insights into crime trends, as well as the progress and impact of ongoing projects aimed at improving access to basic services in the area. It can also be easily customized for use by other organizations, integrating with data sources to provide real-time information that supports informed decision-making.
