## Overview

Development of auto parts data, quote history management and analytics tool built with Retool and Cloud sql.

## Key Features

- **CSV Upload**: Bulk-upload functionality is available for every features that require data entry, with seamless error, missing, and invalid data handling.
- **Robust Data Validation**: Data validation step is added for any data upload or manual data entry processes.
- **Interactive and Informative Dashboard**: Tables, charts, and other dashboard elements for easier data visualization and reporting.
- **Data Export**: Any data visualized in table can be filtered, selected and exported either in csv or PDF format.

## Technologies Used

- **Retool**: Low-code UI builder, built on top of react.
- **Cloud sql - Mysql**: Google cloud platform service for data storage.
- **BiqQuery**: Google cloud platform service for big data analytics.

## Challenges and Learnings

The challenge was designing a scalable, high-performance database to store auto parts equivalency and application data, where parts have transitive relationships (e.g., Part A ≡ Part B, Part B ≡ Part C). To handle this, we used joint-tables to store many-to-many relationships, ensuring effective storage and retrieval while preventing duplicates and data anomalies. This experience highlighted the importance of understanding business operations to improve system and database design.

## Outcome

The tool is now actively used by the company to manage auto parts information and track quote history, with many features currently in development.
